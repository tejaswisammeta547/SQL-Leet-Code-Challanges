/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

WITH LogsWithLag AS (
    SELECT num,
    LAG(num) OVER (order by id) as prev_num,
    LEAD(num) OVER (order by id) as next_num
    FROM Logs
)

Select DISTINCT num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM LogsWithLag
WHERE num = prev_num AND num = next_num
ORDER BY ConsecutiveNums;
